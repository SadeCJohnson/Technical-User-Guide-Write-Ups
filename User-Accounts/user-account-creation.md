# How A User Can Become An Account Owner

## To learn how to become an account owner, the linked tutorial will provide the procedural steps to 
creating a Firefox User Account. 
* Tune into my **firefox-account-user-experience** channel https://discord.gg/UFtsMCA to see the step-by-step guide.
* The purpose of this channel is to discuss a user's experience when they are an account owner. The user experience will be explained from the perspective of 
  becoming a firefox account owner.

## Tools Used In The Documentation Process
- **Discord** - to create the procedural steps.
- **Firefox** - is the relevant browser for this activity.
- **Ubuntu's gNome** tool - to screenshot the relevant visuals.
- **Kolourpaint** -  to mark up / modify screenshots where appropriate.
- **Ubuntu Terminal** - to download the required/accessory applications to complete tasks.

## Future Implementation
* Providing a   UML or similar diagram to help readers visualize the concepts captured in the written tutorial.
* A separate document that explains the backend (or developer's perspective) of creating a user account.
In other words, an explanation of what happens **behind the scenes** will be provided.
