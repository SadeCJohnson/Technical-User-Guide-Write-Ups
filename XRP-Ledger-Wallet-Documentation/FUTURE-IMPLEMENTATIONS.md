# Future Implementation:

### In the future, the following information should be considered:

- Explain the difference between **private keys** and **public keys** and discuss the importance.
- Explain how **wallet addresses** are secure and why they aren't traceable back to the individual.
- Increase font size on diagrams to improve document readability.
- Include the Contact information of **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** and their area of expertise
  so the developers will know exactly who to reach out to when stuck. 
    - This will increase and maintain productivity; eliminating delays in release schedules.
- Technical Writing Hotline information to maintain an open door policy to ensure that concerns are being
  addressed in a timely manner.
- Discuss the **Customer Impact** as a result of the introduction of the **Native XRP Ledger Wallet**. 
    - What steps do they need to take to prepare for this change?
- Indicate that the developer should connect directly to the **Ripple API** to access the XRP Ledger, rather than via
a Middleware API (per the [EcoSystem Tech Stack Diagram](/resources/visuals/xrp-tech-stack-level.png))
