- Because the **Paper Wallet**  type is considered to be obsolete, it is **not** depicted in the photo.

### How do Crypto Wallets work?

#### Crypto wallets:
- do **not** store the currency
- acts as a tool to interact with the blockchain 
- generates the necessary [information](#info) required to receive and send money via blockchain 
  transactions
  
#### Information: <a name="info"></a>

- private key
  - should **never** be shared
  - can be used on any wallet for accessing the crypto
  - by knowing this key, one will be able to access the corresponding funds on any device 
- public keys
- based on the keys, an alphanumeric identifier **address** is generated
   - the **address**:
     - specifies the location which coins can be sent to the blockchain
     - can be shared to receive funds
   
- Cryptocurrency coins **never** leave the blockchain, but are just transferred from one address to another.
