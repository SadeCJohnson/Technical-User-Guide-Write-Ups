# XRP Ledger Wallet Integration

## Scope:
* **Developer Task:** Develop a Wallet application that will enable users to interact with the XRP Ledger to perform transactions.
* **Document Task:** This document will dissect the requirements for completing this task at a high level.

## Audience:
Developers


        

## Prerequisites:

### Understanding the Frontend Via the User Experience:
#### View Tutorial:
* To better understand what the user experience consists of, please take some time to review the [XRP Toolkit tutorial](https://docs.xrptoolkit.com/user-interface-overview) that demonstrates what the 
User Interface Interaction is like, to gain a full scope of the connections being made on the **frontend**. This information can then be used to visualize the connections that need to be made on the **backend**.

### Understanding the Backend Features:
#### Questions to consider:

* What Digital Wallet does XRP currently use in order to perform transactions?
    * What system will XRP be replacing once the Native XRP Ledger Wallet is created?  
    * How does the current digital wallet system work?  
    * What APIs do XRP expose to this digital wallet system for actions to be performed?    
        * What type of authentication is required to access the XRP Ledger?
        * What security protocols does the application need to configure?
