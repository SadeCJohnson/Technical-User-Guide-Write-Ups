# Technical User Guide Write-Ups

* The pupose of this repository is to provide links to topic specific discord channels that consist of my technical write-ups. 

# Why was Discord Selected For Technical Write-ups in place of Markdown?
* Discord channels are used in place of Markdown because it's more concise in nature with attention to the raw steps, along with the appropriate visuals.
  * Markdown will **not** be used for these markups since it may be distracting to the neo generation of developers and users who prefer reading procedural steps without the fancy graphics.
  * In addition, discord is a modern channel of communication that individuals of all industries use due to it's seamless nature. To learn more about the advantages of discord, 
  please visit https://discord.com/. 
  * Discord allows steps to be updated live, and these changes will be immediately reflected to users in the channel. 
    * Technical Writers are required to communicate across disciplines (i.e. engineers, compliance, other SMES) regarding the requested designs. Because discord
    allows for real-time communication that persists in chats (unless deleted by the original poster of a piece of communication), it is **preferred** over 
    more legacy tools.
    * To reiterate, Users of the guides (whether developers or customers),will have access to **the most updated changes**, which ultimately speeds up productivity for
    everyone.
    * Because the Discord channel of communication was initially launched on **May 13th 2015**, my use of such an application demonstrates my support for cutting edge technology and 
    the startup culture.
 
  
 * If you are interested in me providing a technical write-up of the advantages, please feel free to contact me via the submission of a feature request.
 
 
 # Will API Guides Be Documented Via Discord as Well?
 
 * No, more appropriate technical writing tools will be used to document the flow of APIS. However, the links to these documents will be cited in the topic
 specific discord channel where appropriate.
